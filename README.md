The goal of this project was to analyze the impact of the 2008 recession and demographic factors on personal income in New York State. Our study utilized three datasets: the first contained personal income data by county in 1998, 2008, and 2017; the second detailed the racial composition of counties in 2017; and the third provided population density data for the same year. Our findings revealed that, despite the economic downturn of 2008, personal income across New York State counties changed proportionally over time. This meant that all counties were impacted equally by the 2008 recession. While we found correlations between income, population density, and racial diversity, our analysis also highlighted the presence of numerous other factors influencing average income that remain unexplored.

One particularly interesting observation was the consistent trend that counties closer to New York City tend to have higher average incomes, greater population densities, and more racial diversity compared to counties further away.

This project was submitted as the final assignment for "Spatial Fundamentals." (DIDA-370)
